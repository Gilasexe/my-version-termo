hi there, just a few instructions if you want to execute in any pc (Windows)

pyinstaller --onefile --name termo_beta_v1 termo_demo.py

this line of code will make your termo demo a executable file, you will need
the pyinstaller first

pip install pyinstaller

this line will install the pyinstaller for you, then you can make the executable
of the ia version as well

pyinstaller --onefile --name termo_beta_v1_ia termo_demo_ia.py

just rename it if necessary, anyway, enjoy it!
